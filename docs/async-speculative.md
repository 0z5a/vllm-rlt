# Cross-round asynchronous self-speculation

This opt-in path uses fixed-depth Ouro, `last_exited` KV, greedy sampling,
Triton attention, eager CUDA execution, and refill scheduling. Historical tests used H20;
FlashAttention is not required. Draft depth is configurable, with `d=2, D=4`
as the initial validation configuration. The target depth must match the model.

```python
from vllm_rlt import LLM, ExecutionConfig, SamplingParams, SpeculativeConfig

llm = LLM(
    "artifacts/models/Ouro-1.4B",
    device="cuda",
    attention_backend="triton",
    execution_config=ExecutionConfig(async_scheduling=True),
    speculative_config=SpeculativeConfig(num_speculative_tokens=4),
)
outputs = llm.generate(
    ["Explain speculative decoding."],
    SamplingParams(temperature=0, max_loops=4, exit_threshold=1.0, max_tokens=64),
)
```

The CLI combines `--async-scheduling --attention-backend triton
--speculative-tokens 4 --draft-loops 2 --target-loops 4 --temperature 0`.
Random sampling, adaptive exit, CUDA Graphs, preemption and PD are rejected.
The speculative runner owns its compute and result-copy streams. Setting
`multi_stream=False` orders the copy on the compute stream as well; cross-round
CPU/GPU submission remains asynchronous, but D2H no longer overlaps computation.

## Execution and ownership

The synchronous runner reads the acceptance result before constructing the next
round. Cross-round submission needs a different ownership contract: the GPU must
advance the next token and actual KV position while the CPU reserves a safe upper
bound. `KVCacheManager._prepare_device_batch()` creates and validates a borrowed
`_DeviceKVBatch` containing allocation identities and device access tensors,
without retaining the manager. The runner owns those tensors and completion
events, and retains allocations until the final GPU reader completes. The batch
does not treat uncommitted positions as populated CPU KV. The scheduler tracks outstanding
output reservations separately from committed tokens.

A simpler alternative is to copy each result asynchronously but wait before
submitting the next round for that request. That can overlap independent requests,
but retains a CPU dependency between consecutive rounds. The two-bank design
removes that dependency at the cost of device state, reservation slack and up to
one discarded round after EOS. The existing synchronous speculative path remains
available by disabling `async_scheduling`; ordinary decoding remains the default
when no `SpeculativeConfig` is supplied.

Prefill and the first sampled token use the native bootstrap path. Thereafter,
the GPU retains each request's next input token and actual position. A round
drafts candidates, retains shallow hidden states, verifies the deep loops in a
batch, and selects the accepted prefix plus correction/bonus on device. Each
query row has its own context length; no packed FlashAttention path is used.

Two reusable `SpeculativeRoundBuffer` slots allow the CPU to submit the next round before delivering the
previous result. All request computation runs in stream order. CPU positions
include outstanding output reservations and are upper bounds used only for
capacity allocation; GPU positions determine RoPE, KV writes and attention.
Requests near output/context limits may wait for a result to recover rejected
reservation capacity. An effective K of zero is a full-depth single-token step.

For a round beginning at position `s` with `a` accepted candidates, the valid
KV frontier and next input position are `s+a+1`. Invalid suffix bytes may remain
in allocated pages, but attention lengths exclude them. The CPU never truncates
GPU state when collecting an older round. CPU `written` bookkeeping continues
to describe native prefill, not in-flight speculative decode; device descriptors
use the reserved allocation and stream-ordered writes instead. Only completed
full prompt pages are eligible for prefix caching.

Every ticket owns its result buffer and page-table snapshot until compute and
copy events complete. EOS/length stopping is applied in output order on the CPU;
one already-submitted later round can finish but its outputs are discarded.
Cancellation removes scheduling eligibility immediately. KV allocations and
device state survive until their final GPU user completes. Request object
identity isolates stale tickets when a request ID is reused.

## Validation

Inside a Slurm GPU allocation, use the repository environment:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_async_speculative.py --run-gpu -q
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_serving.py --run-gpu -k speculative -q
```

The tests exercise two GPU rounds before CPU delivery, every rejection position,
K/length boundaries, mixed requests, prefix reuse, EOS, cancellation, ID reuse
and partially submitted failures. CPU-only test results do not qualify the GPU
path. Compare BF16 runs on the same hardware and Triton backend: synchronous
speculation versus asynchronous speculation, and fixed-depth native async versus
async speculation. Record committed tokens, variability, memory and traces;
do not infer a speedup from successful asynchronous submission alone.

The page-table snapshot uses flat reusable pinned/device storage. Each round
views only `batch_size * max_loops * active_page_width` entries as a contiguous
three-dimensional table, clears that region and copies it once. Inactive storage
is untouched; ragged rows are padded within the active width. This reduces the
number of entries prepared and submitted for H2D. The current measurements below
separate that reduction from end-to-end effects.

## Current GPU validation (2026-10-10)

Runtime source: `d977817d4e174cbc2fcc9aa7ef5893c35da2ec89`, incorporating main
`d704aee654235f6a13e8c5bf13b41aaf80fbb7d9`. Slurm jobs 4830/4832/4834/4839 used
one scheduler-reserved NVIDIA H20-3e on `vllm-h20-02`, TP=1, Python 3.10.20,
PyTorch 2.11.0+cu128, CUDA 12.8 and Triton 3.6.0. Real Ouro-1.4B weights and KV
were BF16, with greedy fixed-depth `d=2, D=4`, `last_exited` KV and eager execution.

The async test module passed **26 tests** (22 CUDA cases and four CPU helpers).
Related speculation, async state/pipeline, HTTP serving and CUDA Graph regression
passed **148 tests**, with 15 FlashAttention cases deselected. This includes both
synchronous speculative ragged CUDA Graph capture/replay cases. The initial
related run had 12 failures importing the absent FA3 `flash_attn` package and
three FA4 cases deselected; these environment failures are retained in the logs,
and neither FlashAttention backend is qualified by the Triton rerun.

The Mac CPU suite passed **477 tests**, with 164 skips: 135 GPU cases not enabled,
26 missing optional `lm_eval`, and three Nanbeige cases missing official assets.
Ruff lint/format passed. Pyright on changed runtime modules reported the same
49 diagnostics as integrated main, with none in the async module; this is baseline
parity rather than a clean whole-project type check.

### Matched BF16 measurements

All **80 unprofiled measured trials** and their warmups matched the fixed-depth
native async baseline's output token IDs exactly. The four modes share the model,
prompt IDs, output budget, backend and KV capacity. Native async uses `ouro_delayed`
at threshold 1; speculation uses fixed-depth `ouro`, K=2. Each cell has five
observations after warmup; mode order reverses on alternate repetitions. EOS is
ignored, and the fixed English prompt is repeated/truncated to the listed lengths.
Maximum sequences is 32, token budget 4096 and prefill chunk size 128. KV capacity
per case is `32 * ceil((prompt + output) / 16) * 4` blocks, matched across modes.

`Async full` is an ablation on the current source that prepares/transfers the
full 32 x 4 x 4096 table; `Async active` uses the committed contiguous active
region. Both wrappers expose the same logical table extents to draft/verify and
have the same wrapper overhead. This isolates preparation/transfer capacity;
it is not a performance measurement of the old PR head.

Committed decode throughput excludes each request's first token. Timing begins
after all first outputs and bootstrap GPU work complete, and ends after final GPU
work completes. Values are median `[min, max]` tokens/s over five observations;
the ranges are descriptive, not confidence intervals. Profiler is disabled.

| Prompt/output | Concurrency | Native async | Sync spec | Async full | Async active |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 64/8 | 1 | 19.62 [18.96, 19.89] | 28.72 [28.56, 28.98] | 29.36 [29.08, 29.51] | 29.02 [28.36, 29.53] |
| 64/32 | 1 | 19.51 [19.07, 19.58] | 29.85 [29.25, 30.22] | 30.14 [29.92, 30.34] | 30.32 [29.48, 30.44] |
| 64/32 | 8 | 154.23 [153.57, 155.85] | 236.45 [234.29, 237.60] | 242.53 [240.97, 243.44] | 243.00 [242.51, 243.51] |
| 512/128 | 1 | 19.87 [19.83, 19.92] | 27.49 [26.60, 28.14] | 28.40 [28.22, 28.44] | 28.53 [28.23, 28.71] |

Engine E2E covers request admission through final completed GPU work. It includes
prefill and first token, but excludes client/network latency. Median `[min, max]`
milliseconds under the same protocol:

| Prompt/output | Concurrency | Native async | Sync spec | Async full | Async active |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 64/8 | 1 | 411.28 [406.44, 430.49] | 298.40 [295.59, 301.16] | 292.00 [290.69, 294.45] | 295.40 [290.49, 300.41] |
| 64/32 | 1 | 1644.06 [1637.03, 1683.32] | 1092.83 [1079.53, 1115.31] | 1083.81 [1077.01, 1090.74] | 1077.13 [1073.00, 1109.07] |
| 64/32 | 8 | 1718.17 [1701.54, 1724.73] | 1132.40 [1126.94, 1144.91] | 1106.91 [1103.24, 1112.90] | 1104.71 [1101.74, 1106.22] |
| 512/128 | 1 | 6655.23 [6639.07, 6669.83] | 4858.11 [4750.69, 5013.35] | 4708.12 [4700.69, 4736.14] | 4688.06 [4657.09, 4736.26] |

Async active's median decode throughput exceeds sync speculation by 1.1–3.8%
in these cells. The active/full E2E differences are small, mixed in direction and
have overlapping observed ranges; these five observations do not establish a
stable E2E gain from narrowing the table. The largest allocated-memory peak was
19.03 GiB for either async variant and 18.71 GiB for sync speculation. No memory
reduction is claimed; reserved and allocated peaks are retained per observation.

### Active-region preparation and transfer

A separate warmed microexperiment used 1000 CPU preparations and 100 CUDA-event
H2D observations per variant, with prompt/output 64/32. Both banks are reused,
and copies complete before the CPU mutates pinned storage. Times below are medians;
they are not complete-round or E2E timings.

| Concurrency | Variant | H2D bytes | CPU prepare (us) | H2D event (us) |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | Full capacity | 2,097,152 | 78.51 | 43.55 |
| 1 | Active (1 x 4 x 5) | 80 | 14.22 | 7.42 |
| 8 | Full capacity | 2,097,152 | 98.45 | 43.49 |
| 8 | Active (8 x 4 x 5) | 640 | 34.45 | 7.23 |

This supports the reduced host preparation and transfer work in `_prepare_round()`
and the contiguous table copy in `submit_round()`. It does not imply that the same
microsecond savings appear on the complete request's critical path.

### Separate profiling diagnostics

Warmed prompt/output 64/8, concurrency 1, K=2 was captured separately with CPU
and CUDA activity. Ops-only disables shapes, memory and stacks; full enables all
three and exports actual nonempty CPU/GPU stack and memory records. Full-request
ops traces cover prefill, first token and decode. Matching single-round ops/full
captures cover the first complete draft/verify/acceptance/result-transfer round
after warmed bootstrap, ending after its GPU work completes. The initial
full-request full trace was valid but about 468 MiB, exceeding the 200 MiB capture
budget; it was preserved, and the remaining full captures were narrowed rather
than repeating that oversized window.

The CPU `user_annotation` decode range bounds the union of GPU kernels/copies.
A gap is the remainder of that range, not SM utilization or proof of a host
bottleneck. These single ops-only observations are diagnostic and include profiler
overhead; they do not replace the unprofiled table above.

| Ops-only observation | Async full | Async active | Sync spec |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Request wall (ms) | 500.82 | 513.64 | 513.32 |
| Decode wall (ms) | 407.43 | 422.25 | 424.59 |
| Decode GPU active union (ms) | 64.92 | 64.81 | 64.28 |
| Decode GPU gaps (ms) | 342.51 | 357.44 | 360.31 |
| H2D bytes / copies (whole request) | 6,303,248 / 13 | 12,032 / 13 | 12,864 / 32 |
| H2D summed copy duration (us) | 175.90 | 10.59 | 25.31 |
| D2H copies (whole request) | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| CUDA synchronization calls | 12 | 12 | 10 |
| CPU `aten::item` calls | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The active/full pair reduces copied bytes while copy counts and synchronization
counts remain unchanged. GPU active time changes little. The candidate trace's
longer wall/gap time does not isolate a regression, just as lower transfer time
does not establish E2E improvement. The current synchronous runner also has no
`aten::item` events here; historical scalar-read counts must not be applied to
this merged source. Retiring a collected ticket omits the redundant compute-event
host wait because its copy-completion event already depends on compute completion;
partial-failure drains retain both owned streams. The regression tests check
ordering and lifetime behavior independently of this performance diagnosis.

Both figures use matched scales, grouped activity tracks and an explicit runtime
revision. Short waits/copies may be thinner than a pixel at this scale; their
measured event counts above remain nonzero.

### Evidence and reproduction

Current raw artifacts and local diagnostic scripts are preserved outside the
repository source, under
`/home/leo/slurm-workspaces/rlt-pr66-d977817-20261010/`:
`measure_gpu.py`, `profile_bounded.py`, `profile_paired_ops.py`, Slurm scripts and `evidence/` containing
`bf16-performance.json`, test XML, logs, source/model/tokenizer hashes, ops traces,
full single-round traces, stack exports and memory timelines. The diagnostic
scripts are not supported benchmark entry points. To reproduce the measurement
protocol inside a one-GPU Slurm allocation, copy the frozen checkout and scripts
into a fresh directory containing `repo/` and `evidence/`. Set `PR66_RERUN` to
that directory and use the recorded environment:

```bash
cd "$PR66_RERUN/repo"
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD" HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
/home/leo/vllm-project/vllm-rlt/.venv/bin/python ../measure_gpu.py measure
```

Retain a fresh evidence directory when rerunning rather than overwriting the
captured records. The commands in Validation above remain the supported GPU
regression entry points.

## Historical validation and measured results

The measurements below belong to the 2026-09-23 snapshot: PR44 commit
`d9fca507e766e81f5d89f90d598881c12d7d8397` plus the asynchronous implementation.
They do not qualify current main or the review refactor. The current validation
above is a separate experiment with its own source revision and narrower workload.
Historical logs remain under `/home/leo/slurm-logs/rlt-async-spec/`.

The real Ouro-1.4B checkpoint used BF16 weights, activations and KV, Triton,
one H20-3e on `vllm-h20-02`, TP=1 and `d=2, D=4`. It has 24 shared layers,
hidden size 2048, 16 attention/KV heads and head dimension 128. Source and
model/config hashes were recorded with the results. Native async used
`ouro_delayed` at threshold 1 (full depth); speculative modes used fixed-depth
`ouro`. The same fixed English prompt was repeated/truncated across requests,
with EOS ignored for matched output lengths.

Historical CPU regression passed 289 tests with 11 skips. Related Triton GPU
regression passed 145 tests (3 deselected), and the final focused GPU run passed
24 tests. An earlier all-backend run failed two existing FA4 tests because the
package was unavailable; those failures are excluded from Triton qualification.
The GPU tests exercise every rejection position, two submissions before CPU
readback, FP32/BF16 per-layer/per-depth KV against serial replay, ragged bounds,
prefix reuse, arrivals, EOS, cancellation, ID reuse, partial failure and shutdown.
Token IDs require exact agreement; KV tolerances are FP32 `atol=rtol=4e-5` and
BF16 `atol=0.08, rtol=0.04`. These are targeted correctness checks, not general
model-quality evidence.

For a current rerun, use the commands above on a scheduler-reserved CUDA device.
Compare native async, synchronous speculation and async speculation with the
same BF16 model, prompts, token budget, backend, capacity and GPU. Warm up each
mode, alternate measurement order and retain five unprofiled observations per
cell. Measure committed decode tokens after all first outputs through completed
GPU work; preserve output IDs, delivery timestamps, memory peaks and failures.
Use short contexts (64/32 prompt/output, concurrency 1/8, K=1/2/4/8) and longer
contexts (512/128, concurrency 1/32, K=2). Separately capture warmed ops-only and
full profiles at concurrency 1, K=2. For the active-table change, compare CPU
preparation time, H2D bytes/time and unprofiled end-to-end latency against the
previous full-capacity transfer, especially small batches and short contexts.
The removed historical benchmark is not a supported repository entry point.

## Historical results

All **150 measured trials** (120 short + 30 longer) completed with exact token
agreement against the matched native path. Three additional observations in the
profile job also matched; they are excluded from the table below to preserve the
five-repeat protocol. All runtime and benchmark hashes were checked against the
2026-09-23 measured working tree.

Throughput is committed decode tokens/s, shown as median `[min, max]` over five
observations. The final column compares async speculation with sync speculation.
These ranges describe the observed runs, not confidence intervals.

| Prompt/output | Concurrency | K | Native async | Sync spec | Async spec | Async/sync gain |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 64/32 | 1 | 1 | 19.82 [19.74, 20.09] | 26.80 [26.68, 27.04] | 27.70 [27.04, 27.83] | +3.4% |

| 64/32 | 1 | 8 | 19.92 [19.89, 20.01] | 36.48 [36.23, 36.83] | 37.87 [37.47, 38.07] | +3.8% |
| 64/32 | 8 | 1 | 156.69 [154.97, 158.18] | 207.06 [206.47, 211.72] | 216.65 [215.69, 222.13] | +4.6% |
| 64/32 | 8 | 2 | 159.04 [156.63, 159.69] | 234.64 [230.22, 235.66] | 248.41 [245.01, 248.59] | +5.9% |
| 64/32 | 8 | 4 | 156.09 [154.57, 157.24] | 256.23 [254.39, 257.54] | 271.33 [270.83, 272.62] | +5.9% |
| 64/32 | 8 | 8 | 156.51 [154.94, 157.05] | 277.20 [277.11, 277.84] | 295.62 [294.83, 295.76] | +6.6% |
| 512/128 | 1 | 2 | 19.56 [19.50, 19.84] | 27.07 [26.83, 27.26] | 27.90 [27.68, 28.04] | +3.1% |
| 512/128 | 32 | 2 | 563.26 [561.55, 566.09] | 731.83 [726.46, 732.91] | 837.98 [836.99, 843.34] | +14.5% |

The largest observed allocated-memory peaks were 18.342 GiB for sync speculation
and 18.657 GiB for async speculation (longer case, concurrency 32, K=2). This
implementation retains device state and pinned/device banks; it does not claim a
memory reduction. JSON also contains reserved-memory peaks for every observation.

## Historical profiling analysis

The diagnostic capture is the warmed short workload at concurrency 1, K=2.
`measured_decode` is selected from the CPU `user_annotation` track; PyTorch also
emits a GPU annotation with the same name. GPU-active time is the union of kernel
and copy intervals clipped to that CPU decode range. GPU gap is the remainder,
including dispatch gaps and boundary waiting. These profiled durations include
instrumentation overhead and must not replace the unprofiled throughput table.

| Decode observation | Sync spec | Async spec |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Wall time (ms) | 1716.04 | 1668.54 |
| GPU active union (ms) | 274.40 | 274.61 |
| GPU gaps (ms) | 1441.64 | 1393.93 |
| Kernel count | 116295 | 116977 |
| CUDA launch calls | 100136 | 100829 |
| CUDA synchronization calls | 503 | 25 |
| CPU time inside CUDA synchronization (ms) | 4.389 | 0.083 |
| CPU `aten::item` calls | 51 | 0 |
| H2D copies | 451 pageable | 12 pinned |
| D2H copies | 51 | 10 |

Prefill plus first-token preparation occupies 87.37/83.62 ms in the two profiled
captures; its GPU active time is 19.73 ms in both. No prefill speed claim is made.
The full figure starts at the first recorded CPU operator and marks decode start;
the zoom aligns the first 40 ms of decode. Both use identical scales and equivalent
CPU, CUDA synchronization, GPU-kernel and GPU-copy tracks.

![Aligned prefill and decode timeline](images/async-speculative-timeline.png)

![Aligned first 40 ms of decode](images/async-speculative-zoom.png)

GPU active time is essentially unchanged. The device-owned frontier removes
candidate/acceptance scalar reads and replaces repeated pageable metadata uploads
with a per-round pinned table snapshot. That matches the reduced synchronization
and copy counts. Extra device bookkeeping slightly increases launch/kernel counts.
The captured decode gap falls by 47.71 ms, whereas time blocked inside CUDA
synchronization falls by only 4.31 ms: the entire difference cannot be attributed
to blocking waits alone. Reduced host coordination is consistent with the measured
speedup; one profiled pair does not isolate every component of that difference.
The eager path remains dominated by launch/dispatch gaps in this trace.

Layer reports use `_paged_attention_kernel` as one anchor per physical layer and
24 anchors per core pass. The selected pass 5 is the second draft loop of the
first decode round, after the four prefill passes; this is a warmed capture,
regardless of the generic analyzer's automatic `cold-start` label on pass 0.
Anchor spans cross module boundaries and are navigation aids, not exact module
hook timings. Representative kernel reports and all-pass tables are retained.

## Qualification limits

These historical engine microbenchmarks do not establish production HTTP
capacity, TTFT or general model quality. Repeated identical prompts do not
represent all serving traffic; concurrency 32 is a tested point, not a saturation
limit. The current runs cover K=2 and concurrency 1/8; they do not validate K=1/4/8,
concurrency 32, production capacity, other GPUs/checkpoints, random sampling,
adaptive depth, asynchronous CUDA Graphs, FA4, preemption or PD. Keep the
synchronous path until the missing capabilities are covered and validated.
